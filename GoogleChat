[R1.4.3] Preferred domain (already confirmed as carcupid.in). [R1.1] Any sub-domain or specific URL for the landing page (e.g., carcupid.in/detailing). [R1.1] Favicon file. [R1.6.2]	High
Content - Text	Main Headline: A compelling, keyword-rich headline (H1) for the landing page. [R1.6.3] Subheadings: Section titles (H2, H3, etc.) for services, about us, testimonials, etc., incorporating keywords. [R1.6.3] Body Copy: Detailed, benefit-driven descriptions for each service, focusing on unique selling propositions. [R1.5.3] Call-to-Action (CTA) Text: Short, action-oriented phrases for buttons.

WordPress vs. Bootstrap HTML for SEO on Hostinger
WordPress with SEO Plugins: WordPress is generally considered very user-friendly for SEO because of plugins like Yoast SEO or Rank Math. [R1.3.2] These plugins help with meta tags, sitemaps, schema markup, and content analysis, simplifying SEO tasks for those less experienced with manual coding. [R1.3.2] Hostinger offers WordPress-optimized servers, potentially boosting WordPress site speed. [R1.11.1]
Static Bootstrap HTML: A well-coded static HTML site using Bootstrap can achieve excellent SEO results, sometimes even outperforming WordPress in terms of raw loading speed. [R1.3.3] However, achieving similar SEO results requires manual implementation of many of the features that WordPress plugins provide automatically. [R1.3.2] This demands careful attention to detail and ongoing monitoring of SEO best practices. [R1.3.2] Bootstrap's mobile-first design is a natural fit for Google's mobile-first indexing, which prioritizes mobile versions of sites for ranking. [R1.1.3, 1.5.4] Hostinger's Business Hosting offers features like SSD storage, unlimited bandwidth, and Cloudflare integration, all of which contribute to faster loading times and can enhance a Bootstrap site's SEO. [R1.11.3] 
Is converting to WordPress required for better SEO? Not necessarily. If you are comfortable implementing all SEO best practices manually and regularly, a Bootstrap HTML site can rank very well. [R1.3.3] WordPress simplifies this process, making it easier for non-developers or those who want to focus more on content than code. [R1.3.2] 
Achieving similar SEO results with Bootstrap/Hostinger/HTML
On-Page SEO:
Keyword Optimization: Research and strategically use target keywords in your H1 heading, subheadings (H2, H3), title tag, meta description, image alt text, and body copy. [R1.6.3]
Content Quality: Create high-quality, relevant, and useful content focused on local customers and services offered in Pune. [R1.6.3]
Schema Markup: Manually implement LocalBusiness and Service schema markup (JSON-LD) to help Google understand your business details and services. [R1.4.2]
Internal & External Links: Include relevant internal links between sections of your landing page. [R1.6.3] Include external links to authoritative local resources or partner websites where appropriate. [R1.4.2]
URL Structure: Keep URLs clean, concise, and descriptive, incorporating keywords where natural. [R1.6.3]
Mobile-Friendliness: Bootstrap provides a mobile-first framework. [R1.5.1] Ensure your implementation maintains this responsiveness and loads quickly on mobile devices. [R1.5.4, 1.3.4]
Page Speed Optimization: Minify CSS and JavaScript, optimize images (lazy loading, responsive images), and leverage browser caching (Hostinger helps with this). [R1.6.3] A static HTML site can be inherently faster if coded well. [R1.12.2]
Robots.txt and Sitemap.xml: Create and correctly configure these files. [R1.6.2] The sitemap helps search engines discover your pages. [R1.3.3]
HTTPS: Hostinger provides free SSL certificates, ensuring secure data transmission. [R1.11.3]
Off-Page SEO:
Google My Business (GBP) Optimization: Ensure the GBP listing is fully optimized with accurate and consistent NAP information, categories, images, and reviews. [R1.6.5] This is critical for local ranking. [R1.4.2, 1.6.5]
Local Citations: Ensure CarCupid is listed in relevant local business directories with consistent information. [R1.4.4]
Backlinks: Work on acquiring backlinks from reputable local businesses, industry-relevant sites, or news sources. [R1.4.2]
Technical & Hosting:
Hostinger Business Server: Leveraging the features like fast SSD storage, unlimited bandwidth, and built-in security features will support strong SEO. [R1.11.3] Their server locations in India can benefit local targeting. [R1.11.3] 
Alternatives to Streamlit for simple content display/forms without public code
Since you want to avoid displaying the code (like with GitHub Pages and Streamlit) and focus on a simple Bootstrap HTML landing page, you'll need to handle any dynamic elements, like form submissions, with more conventional web development approaches: [R1.8.2] 
HTML Forms + Backend Script: This is the most common and robust approach. [R1.10.1]
Create the form structure (inputs, labels, submit button) directly in your Bootstrap HTML. [R1.5.4]
For Submission: The form will need to submit its data to a server-side script (e.g., PHP, Python with Flask/FastAPI, Node.js with Express). [R1.10.1]
Hostinger Business Hosting supports these technologies. [R1.11.1] You would write a small script on the server to receive the form data, process it (e.g., send an email, save to a file or database), and potentially redirect the user to a "Thank You" page. [R1.10.1] This keeps your core logic hidden on the server. [R1.10.1]
Data Storage: If you need to store the leads, you'd use a database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) with the server-side script. [R1.10.1] Hostinger Business Hosting offers MySQL databases. [R1.11.1]
Secure Input: Implement server-side validation and sanitization for all user input to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). [R1.10.2] Never trust client-side validation alone. [R1.10.2]
Third-Party Form Services:
Utilize a reputable form builder service (e.g., Google Forms, Typeform, Jotform). These services provide embeddable forms and handle data collection and storage securely. [R1.9.1]
Advantages: No need to write server-side code for form submission or manage a database. [R1.9.1] They often offer analytics and integration with other tools. [R1.9.1]
Disadvantages: Less customization than a custom backend solution, and may require a paid plan for advanced features or to remove branding. [R1.7.1] 
Choosing the right approach depends on your development skills, the level of control desired, and whether CarCupid anticipates needing more complex backend functionality in the future.

# CarCupid Landing Page Development Standards

## 1. Project Overview & Tech Stack

*   **Project Goal:** Create a high-performance, mobile-responsive Bootstrap HTML landing page for CarCupid, focusing on generating leads via strong local SEO in Pune. No e-commerce or blog required.
*   **Client:** CarCupid - Car Accessories and Detailing Service in Pune, India. [1.11, 1.8]
*   **Hosting Environment:** Hostinger Business Web Server.
*   **Frontend Technologies:** Bootstrap 5 (or the latest stable version if compatible), HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla or minimal library for interactivity/forms).
*   **Backend (for form submission only):** A simple server-side script (e.g., PHP on Hostinger) for handling contact form submissions securely. No database expected for lead storage unless specified.

## 2. Coding Standards & Structure

*   **HTML Structure:**
    *   Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, etc.).
    *   Ensure a single `<h1>` tag per page for the main landing page headline.
    *   Use `<h2>` and `<h3>` tags for subheadings, ordered logically for content hierarchy and keyword targeting.
    *   Prioritize accessibility (a11y): Use proper `alt` attributes for images, semantic tags, and ARIA attributes where needed.
*   **CSS Usage:**
    *   Primarily leverage Bootstrap's utility classes and components.
    *   For custom styling, create a separate `style.css` file. Avoid inline styles or directly modifying Bootstrap files.
    *   Ensure CSS is clean, well-commented, and avoids specificity wars.
    *   Use variables for common colors, fonts, etc.
*   **JavaScript:**
    *   Use vanilla JavaScript or minimal libraries. Avoid heavy frameworks if not essential.
    *   Ensure JavaScript is clean, efficient, and non-blocking for page load.
    *   Handle client-side form validation using Bootstrap's features where possible.
    *   Ensure backend script integration for form submission is secure and robust (refer to backend script rule if created).
*   **File Structure (Example):**
    ```
    .
    ├── index.html                  # Main landing page
    ├── assets/
    │   ├── css/
    │   │   └── style.css           # Custom CSS
    │   ├── js/
    │   │   └── main.js             # Custom JavaScript
    │   └── img/
    │       ├── hero-image.webp
    │       ├── service-icon-1.svg
    │       └── ...
    ├── .cursor/
    │   └── rules/
    │       └── landing-page-seo.mdc # This rule file
    └── README.md
    ```

## 3. SEO Best Practices (Local Focus for Pune)

*   **Keyword Integration:**
    *   Integrate researched keywords naturally throughout the page: title tag, meta description, `<h1>`, `<h2>` tags, image `alt` attributes, and main content.
    *   Prioritize local keywords (e.g., "car detailing Pune," "ceramic coating Pashan," "car accessories Baner").
*   **Meta Tags:**
    *   Ensure `title` tags are unique, descriptive, and include primary keywords and location (e.g., "Car Detailing & Accessories in Pune - CarCupid").
    *   Ensure `meta description` is compelling, includes keywords, and encourages clicks.
    *   Use `viewport` meta tag for responsiveness: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">`.
    *   Include necessary Open Graph (OG) and Twitter Card meta tags for social sharing.
*   **Schema Markup:**
    *   Implement `LocalBusiness` schema markup (JSON-LD) in the `<head>` or `<body>`.
    *   Include business name, address, phone number (NAP), website URL, opening hours, reviews, and services offered.
    *   Consider `Service` schema for specific offerings.
*   **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Optimize images for web (correct format, size, compression). Use responsive images.
    *   Minify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    *   Leverage browser caching where appropriate (facilitated by Hostinger).
    *   Minimize reliance on large external libraries if possible.
*   **Accessibility (a11y):**
    *   Ensure the page is navigable and usable by people with disabilities.
    *   Use appropriate ARIA attributes for interactive elements.
    *   Maintain sufficient color contrast.
*   **Google My Business Consistency:**
    *   Ensure all NAP details on the landing page exactly match the Google My Business listing.
    *   Include a Google Map embed of the location.

## 4. UI/UX & Conversion Focus

*   **Clear Value Proposition:** Prominently display CarCupid's unique selling points (USPs).
*   **Compelling Headlines:** Use engaging, benefit-driven headlines that capture attention.
*   **Strong Call-to-Actions (CTAs):**
    *   Place prominent, clear CTAs ("Get a Free Quote Now," "Book Appointment," "Contact Us") strategically throughout the page.
    *   Use buttons or links that visually stand out.
*   **Social Proof:** Feature testimonials or review snippets, ideally mentioning local customers or services.
*   **Contact Information:** Ensure contact number, address, and Google Map are easily findable.
*   **Lead Capture Form:**
    *   Use a simple, mobile-friendly contact form asking for only essential information.
    *   Ensure form submissions are handled reliably by the backend script.
    *   Add a link to the Privacy Policy near the form.

## 5. Hosting & Deployment

*   **Hostinger Business Hosting:** Optimize the HTML/CSS/JS deployment for Hostinger's environment.
*   **HTTPS:** Ensure SSL is enabled (Hostinger provides free SSL).
*   **CORS Configuration:** If a separate backend for the form is used, ensure CORS is correctly configured on the Hostinger server (via `.htaccess` or PHP script if needed).

## 6. Verification Steps (for AI & Developer)

*   **Code Linting/Validation:** Ensure HTML is valid, CSS is clean, and JS has no errors.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness:** Confirm layout and functionality are perfect on various mobile devices (check Chrome DevTools emulator).
*   **Page Speed Testing:** Verify optimal loading times using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights.
*   **SEO Audit:** Run a quick SEO audit (e.g., Lighthouse) to check meta tags, schema, keyword usage.
*   **Accessibility Audit:** Perform a quick audit for common accessibility issues.
*   **Form Functionality Test:** Verify the contact form submits correctly and leads are received.

## 7. Instructions for Cursor AI Interaction

*   When generating HTML structure, use Bootstrap classes for layout (`container`, `row`, `col-md-x`, etc.) and components (`btn`, `card`, `form-control`).
*   When writing copy, always incorporate provided keywords naturally and focus on local Pune context and benefits for the customer.
*   Ensure all images generated or suggested have descriptive `alt` attributes.
*   Prioritize performance and mobile-first design in all code suggestions.
*   Provide clear examples for implementing schema markup (LocalBusiness, Service) in JSON-LD format.
*   When developing the contact form, ensure it aligns with Bootstrap styles and includes client-side validation. Suggest options for backend handling (PHP on Hostinger).
